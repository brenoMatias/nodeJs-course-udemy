Node Modules:

When we define a function it goes to the global scope

we should avoid defining variables and functions
in the global scope. Instead we need modularity we need to
create small building blocks or modules where we define
our variables and functions.

every file in a Node application is considered a
module. The variables and functions defined in that function or
module are a scope to that file. 


So in Node,
every file is a module, and the variables and functions
defined and in that file are a scope to that module, they are not available


Creating a module:
'logger.js'
