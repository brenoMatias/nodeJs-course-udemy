// The createServer method creates a server on your computer:
// The http. createServer() method creates an HTTP Server object. The HTTP Server object can listen to ports on your computer and execute a function, a requestListener, each time a request is made.


//What is HTTP server in Nodejs?
// Node. js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node. js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To include the HTTP module, use the require() method: var http = require('http');
// The http.createServer() method turns your computer into an HTTP server.
// this class inherits
// from net.Server

// // use the on method to handle that event.
// server.on('connection', (actualListener) => {
//     console.log('New conection')

// });



--- OTHER ROUTES IN the backend
 Now if you want to build a backend service for our
web or mobile applications, we need to handle various routes
here. For example, we can have another if block
if request.url = /
api/courses, perhaps here we want to return
the list of courses from the database, so we would do
something like this, reponse.write. Now here we want to
return an array of objects using json.
So, we use JSON.
