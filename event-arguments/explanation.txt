Now quite often, when we want
to raise an event, we also want to send some data about
that event. For example, in our logger module, when we
log a message perhaps our remote login service will
generate an ID for that message, perhaps we want to return that ID
to the client, or it may give us a URL to
access the logged message directly. So here, when raising
an event you can add additional arguments which we refer to
as event arguments. So we can add an event ID
like 1, then we can add a url.
