--------ENVIROMENT VARIABLES


One thing we need to improve in this code
is this hard coded value for the ports. So we have
used 3000 as an arbitrary number, why this may work
on your development machine, it's unlikely it's going to work in the production environment. Because when you deploy this this application to a hosting environment
the port is dynamically assigned by the hosting environment,
so we can't rely on 3000 to be available,
so, the way to fix this is by using an environment variable.
So typically in hosting environments for node applications,
we have this environment variable called ports.
An environment variable is basically a variable that is part of the environment in which a process runs. Its value is set
outside this application

--- Simply put, a production environment is where the latest versions of software, products, or updates are pushed live to the intended users. Think of it as a final phase of production. This is the environment where the end user can see, experience, and interact with the new product.

--- The hosting environment is the physical environment where hosting services are offered from. Typically hosting environment in telecommunication terms would be a Network Operating Centre (NOC) housing the equipment needed to host a service. In simple words, the Hosting Environment mainly consists of two terms.
