First:

   install

      npm i mongoose

Mongoose gives us a simple api to work with a Mongo DB database.
Connect with database



Second: 

   create a schema

Third: 

  Now we need to compile this into a model.
Create class


 Once we have a schema,
we need to compile that into a model, which gives us
a class, next we can create an object based on that class,
and this object maps to a document in Mongo DB database
