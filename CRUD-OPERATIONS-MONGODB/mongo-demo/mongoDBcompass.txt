a collection in MongoDB is like a table in a relational database4The document in MongoDB

The documents is kind of similar to a row in a relational database.


So in relational databases, you have tables, and rows,
in MongoDB we have collections and documents.
Now let's take a look at this collection.

each document is a container of key value pairs

 in Mongoose we have this concept called schema.
This is just specific to Mongoose, it's not part of MongoDB.
We use a schema in Mongoose to define the shape of
documents in a MongoDB collection. So we use that to define
what are the properties we have in this document.
