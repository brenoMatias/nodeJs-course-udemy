we use this command to import data: 

    mongoimport --db mongo-exercises --collection courses --drop --file exercise-data.json --jsonArray


supply a few flags:

   The first one is --db.
Where we specify the name of our database. I want you to use a separate database for these exercises. 

So mongo-exercises. 

The next flag is --collection. 
We set this to courses

another flag that is --file.

And here we pass exercise-data
.json. So I'm running this command from the same folder
where I have this json file. And finally the last flag is

--json array, we need this flag
because the data that we have in this json file is represented using an array as you can see here. So, let's run this command,
import as 7 documents, now let's open up MongoDB compass
